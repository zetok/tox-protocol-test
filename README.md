Test layer between [hstox]
(https://toktok.github.io/design/testing.html#test-protocol) and [zetox]
(https://github.com/zetok/tox).

Additional docs for writing tests are at
https://toktok.github.io/spec#test-protocol

Tests are ran by linking test executable under `hstox/test/` directory and
issuing `cabal test`.

Some setup for `hstox` and `zetox` is required. For more info, refer to their
docs.
